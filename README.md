##SpendWise

Welcome to *SpendWise*, an expense management system designed to help you track and manage your expenses efficiently. This repository contains the full codebase for SpendWise, organised into two main folders: `backend` and `frontend`. Each folder has its own `README.md` file with specific setup and run instructions.


## Project Structure


- **Backend**: Contains the PHP codebase responsible for handling the server-side logic, including API endpoints, database interactions, and authentication. The backend is built using PHP and can be set up to run on a server or locally using tools like Docker.
